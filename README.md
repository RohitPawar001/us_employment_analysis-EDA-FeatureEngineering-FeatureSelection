## Introduction

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) helps in understanding the underlying patterns and relationships in the data. Feature Engineering involves creating new features or modifying existing ones to improve model performance. Feature Selection is the process of selecting the most relevant features for the model.

## Installationhttps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/RohitPawar001/us_employment_analysis-EDA-FeatureEngineering-FeatureSelection
    cd us_employment_analysis-EDA-FeatureEngineering-FeatureSelection
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   

## Usage

1. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd us_employment_analysis-EDA-FeatureEngineering-FeatureSelection
    ```

2. Run the Jupyter notebooks for EDA, Feature Engineering, and Feature Selection:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

3. Open the respective notebooks and follow the instructions to perform EDA, Feature Engineering, and Feature Selection.
